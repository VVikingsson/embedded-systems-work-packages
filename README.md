# Welcome to my course work for Embedded Systems - DIT633!
This is a repository of my collected work from the course Development of Embedded and Real-Time Systems (DIT633). The course includes a thorough introduction to C, with lots of exercises teaching memory handling and bit manipulation (week0-week3) as well as Arduino (week4+)

## Structure
This repository is structured by week in the course, where every week contains a Work Package (wp) with an assignment and a bonus assignment. 

## Run the code
Weeks 1-3 are all self contained scripts. This means you just have to compile and run them. Most of the programs have error handling in place to help with potential CL arguments. Weeks 4 and onward is mostly C++ for Arduino, making it harder to run. 

## Note on the comment infestation
In this course, we had to comment every single line of code unless we wanted lower grades on the assignments. Even though this is a bad practice, I of course followed the requirements given by the teacher.
